                Born and raised in Sydney, Australia, I currently attend Washington University in St. Louis as a rising senior and a Computer Science major. 
                Initially, I chose to study so far from home to play college basketball and continue my academics but I couldn't have anticipated
                that my experience abroad would be comprised of so much more. My time has been filled with incredible people and amazing experiences that have helped
                me to learn and grow as an individual. This includes the opportunity to work across a variety of software engineering roles at 
                AllianceBernstein and Provider Pool Inc.

                More recently, I've been focused on developing my skills as a designer, which is what actually inspired me to build this website! I've 
                thoroughly enjoyed embracing my creativity across different disciplines including: fashion, graphic, and web design. Throughout my academic, athletic, and work experiences I have developed 
                valuable interpersonal, problem-solving, and organizational skills that I look to apply to 2021 full-time positions in product management and software engineering.
