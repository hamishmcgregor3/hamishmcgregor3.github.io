          Worked on the web development team responsible for Bernstein.com, a private wealth management site that offers
          information about AB and its services before login and provides high-net-worth investors with access to
          sensitive account information and various account management actions after login.
          <br />
          <br />
          Utilized frontend (React, JS, HTML & CSS) and backend (.NET, C#, SQL) technologies daily to develop new
          features and resolve support tickets, enhancing the site's functionality and user experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          Led the migration of the site's post-login content from an expiring CMS to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM).
          Built a NuGet Package to handle the site's transition to AEM, incorporating HTTP requests for content
          retrieval, caching for optimized performance, and server-side file monitoring to ensure the latest content was
          displayed.
          <br />
          <br />
          Designed and developed React components for the firm's first design system, built on Material UI and deployed
          via Vercel. The system provided developers with easily customizable, company-branded UI components as reusable
          HTML markup.
          <br />
          <br />
          Developed a suite of frontend tests using TypeScript, simulating user interactions to validate expected
          functionality and ensure correct rendering of DOM elements. Automated the test suite with Cypress and
          integrated it into DevOps pipelines, significantly reducing manual testing efforts and improving deployment
          efficiency.
          <br />
          <br />
          Designed and developed new financial tools for a portfolio management desktop application (.NET WinForms) used
          by portfolio managers to handle account-specific requests for their clients. These tools replaced manually
          executed SQL stored procedures, freeing up developers' time and giving portfolio managers greater autonomy.
          <br />
          <br />
          Integrated Glance Cobrowsing into Bernstein.com, enabling older or less tech-savvy clients to easily share
          their screen with AB financial advisors for assistance in navigating the site and completing account-related
          tasks, while ensuring sensitive financial data remained protected.
          <br />
          <br />
          Completed AB's Technology and Operations Graduate program, which included three 6-month rotations as a
          software developer, gaining experience across multiple teams.
