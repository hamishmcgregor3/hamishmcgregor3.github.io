            Worked on a web development team for Bernstein.com, a web
            application built using .NET.
            <br />
            <br />
            Responsible for developing new features and resolving support
            tickets to address site issues. Utilized both frontend technologies
            (React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS) and backend technologies (C#, .NET,
            SQL) to implement changes, enhancing the site's functionality and
            user experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            Led the migration of the site's post-login content from Methode to
            Adobe Experience Manager. Developed a new content service as a .NET
            class library, consumed as a NuGet package, for the web app to
            accommodate this change in CMS.
            <br />
            <br />
            Styled and developed Material UI Components, for a component library
            hosted in Storybook, that offers developers customizable company
            themed UI components as easily copyable HTML markup.
            <br />
            <br />
            Graduated from ABâ€™s Technology and Operations (TOP) program,
            completing three 6-month rotations as a developer across various
            teams.

            <br />
            Designed and developed financial tools, using .NET WinForms
            applications, to enhance functionality for an in-house wealth
            management service used by portfolio managers. These tools replaced
            manually executed SQL stored procedures, resulting in improved
            efficiency and workflow automation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Implemented an automated frontend test suite utilizing Cypress and
            TypeScript for a bond trading platform. Unit tests simulated user
            activity to validate expected functionality across the web
            application. These tests were integrated into DevOps release
            pipelines, significantly reducing manual testing efforts.
