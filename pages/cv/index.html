            application built using ASP.NET MVC.
            <br />
            <br />
            Responsible for developing new features and resolving support
            tickets to address site issues. Utilized both frontend technologies
            (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Svelte) and backend technologies (C#, .NET,
            SQL) to make these changes, and enhance the site's functionality and
            user experience.
            <br />
            <br />
            Led the migration of the site's post-login content from Methode to
            Adobe Experience Manager, and developed a new content service in C#
            to accommodate this change in CMS.
            <br />

            Styled and developed Material UI Components, for a component library
            hosted in Storybook, that offers developers customizable company
            themed UI components as easily copyable HTML markup.

            <br />
            Graduated from ABâ€™s Technology and Operations (TOP) program,

            applications to enhance functionality for an in-house portfolio
            wealth management service used by portfolio managers. These tools
            replaced manually executed SQL stored procedures, resulting in
            improved efficiency and workflow automation.
            <br />
            <br />
            Implemented an automated frontend test suite utilizing Cypress and
            TypeScript for a bond trading platform. Unit tests simulated user
            activity to validate expected functionality across the web
            application. These tests were integrated into DevOps release
            pipelines, significantly reducing manual testing efforts.
