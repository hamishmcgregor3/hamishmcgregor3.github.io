      <p>
        I’m Hamish, a <strong>Web Developer</strong> and <strong>Designer</strong> with a passion for blending
        technology and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        With programming as my medium, I love bringing digital designs to life through code. I enjoy crafting playful
        visuals and pairing them with seamless and intuitive digital experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I’m building on my professional experience developing scalable Full Stack .NET web applications while
        expanding my front end development and design toolkit. I work with technologies like React, Next.js, and Adobe
        Creative Suite to create dynamic and engaging interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m inspired by design in all its forms, particularly digital, web, UI/UX, and motion design, and I’m constantly
        learning new techniques to elevate my development projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, welcome to <a href="/" class="studio-hamish">STUDIO HAMISH</a>, my new digital home where I'll share a mix
        of
        interests, projects, and work experiences.
      </p>
      <p>Stay Tuned!</p>
